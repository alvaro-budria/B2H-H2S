# B2H-H2S

The aim of this project is to generate convincing body hand poses for sign language production, based on text.
To do so, I will try to combine the recently-published [How2Sign dataset](https://how2sign.github.io/), with the hand-pose generating model called [Body2Hands](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~evonne_ng/projects/body2hands/).
